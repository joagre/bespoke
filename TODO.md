# TODO

## Captive portal

* Make it more streamlined without all of the extra top headers on Iphone and
  extra warnings on Android (in the captive portal browser).

## Web app

* /README.md: Add a small video instead of a screenshot
* Add Signal protocol under the hood
* Rewrite the post record in db.hrl to not use lists for replies, likers
  and attachments, i.e. use idets.erl tables instead in db_post_db.erl.

Later:

* Make it possible to use uploaded files as attachments

## Syncing

* Smart database syncing between B3S devices
