When an Android device connects to an WiFi AP it perform some checks to see if the AP has Internet access. Like this.

DNS: www.google.com -> 142.250.74.68

DNS: connectivitycheck.gstatic.com -> 142.250.74.99

HTTP: connectivitycheck.gstatic.com

I need to emulate this beahviour and I can do that with careful use of dnsmasq and iptables. A problem still remains though. I cannot see what I need to answer to the HTTPS request to emulate that their is Internet connectivity? I could trey to just return 200 OK but now I'm guessing wildly.
