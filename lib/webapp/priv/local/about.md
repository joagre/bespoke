**About Acme Community Hub**

Welcome to the Acme Community Hub, our own private corner of the digital world, powered by Bespoke BBS. Here, members of the Acme community can securely engage in open or private discussions, send direct messages, and seamlessly share files.

Whether it's coordinating projects, organizing social events, or privately exchanging resources, this platform offers:

**Community Forums:** Open conversations, announcements, and discussions to keep everyone informed and involved.

**Private Messaging:** Direct and confidential communication between community members.

**File Sharing:** Simple and secure uploads and downloads, perfect for collaborating on documents, media, and other important files.

Managed entirely by Acme, this private BBS helps strengthen our connections, boost productivity, and safeguard our communications from external interference.

Welcome aboard, and let's keep the conversation going!
